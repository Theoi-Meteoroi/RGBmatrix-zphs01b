# RGBmatrix-zphs01b
Circuit Python implementation of RGBmatrix display for Winsen zphs01b multisensor module

This project uses the Adafruit MatrixPortal M4 serial port to display sensor readings from a Winsen ZPHS01B, a multi-in-one air quality module, integrating laser dust sensor, infrared carbon dioxide sensor, electrochemical formaldehyde sensor, electrochemical ozone sensor, electrochemical carbon monoxide sensor, VOC sensor, NO2 sensor and temperature and humidity sensor. It has a UART ( 3.3v TTL level) communication interface.

The MatrixPortal M4 is pretty handy - providing +5v power to both 64x64 panels as well as the sensor module board. A USB-C port provides power to the entire project.
